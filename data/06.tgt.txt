Step B.4.3: 	Reconfirm anatomical landmarks (414) 

Step B.4.4: 	Perform puncture by tightening the skin (519), flattening out the needle (519) aiming for the vessel (505) and advancing the needle until you feel the clavicle (519), then slightly increase needle angle and advance it underneath the clavicle (520) with a bit of negative pressure on syringe (522)

Step B.4.5: IF get free flow of blood, THEN GOTO Task B.5

Task B.5: 	Pass guidewire (42)

Step B.5.1.1: Disconnect syringe while keeping thumb over end of needle to avoid air embolisms (563).
